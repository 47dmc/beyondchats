# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Note for the Recruiter: 

This is a simple project made using react.js and vite as per the description on the  assignment.
I have created 3 sections "Home", "setup your organization" and "chatbot Integration" which I imported and Routed using ("react-router-dom") in the App.jsx.

*** for the auto fetching of the meta-data I created some dummy quotes in the "setup your organization" section and on submit it shows some random data using Math.random() method.

The website is fully responsive on all devices and I have used confetti using "react-confetti" for the animation when the Integration of the chatbot is successfull in the chatbot Integration section.

To test the chatBot i have created a dummy chatting Box (which obviously doesn't work) and to Integrate the chatbot to the organization's website I have created a dummy script to copy.
